## ❕ ⦁ Notes:
These covers are made in a size of `1000x598` to be used at a resolution of `1600x900`, using them in other resolutions might cause color bars to appear at the edges of the covers.

## ✏️ ⦁ Creation:
* If you want to create a cover for a game or app, make a 1000x598 canvas in your favorite photo editing app and then add images to make the cover, or crop an image to 1000x598.  
* You can also create a new issue with the name of the game or app you want, and I'll make a cover for it (Just keep in mind that this isn't my whole life lol, I also have other things to do).

## ✅ ⦁ Usage:
1. Download the cover of the game or app you want.  
2. Go to your app options in ARMOURY CRATE SE (X button).  
3. Select Game Info → Select Game Art → Add → Select the cover you downloaded.  
4. The cover will apear on screen → Select it → Done (X button).
5. Go Back.
6. Done! You'll see the game or app cover changed.
